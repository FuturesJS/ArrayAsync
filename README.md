ArrayAsync
===

v3.x - Diet Cola Edition

Async counterparts for each of the Array methods

  * forEachAsync
  * everyAsync
  * someAsync
  * filterAsync
  * mapAsync
  * reduceAsync
  * reduceRightAsync\* (uses reversed copy of original array)

The might all work, but map, reduce, and reduceRight haven't been tested yet
